Question 1
I see a rabbit on a black screen that when clicked, I can drag around. When I open another tab and perform a click/drag action I see that both tabs update.

Question 2
Typescript is a compiled language whereas JS does not need to be compiled as such. Typescrpit allows for static typing and generics whereas JS does not have a concept for that. TS is considered Object oriented whereas JS is considered a scripting language. 

Question 3
Web application bundlers are useful for modern web projects because they allow for several convenience features. Transpiling of langauges into Html,css or JS. They allow for minifying: make files smaller, concatenation: put lots of code together into less files. uglify: to prevent copying of code.
ParcelJs features include hotmodule replacement(update as you make changes), bundling of all assets, automatic transofrms, and freidnly error logging.
